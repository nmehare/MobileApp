## About

TechQuiz will provide every individual to validate and test their knowledge and a method of assessment for evaluating expertise, skills and capabilities. An examination is usually a cumulative evaluation that tests someone over a wide period and over a variety of materials. A quiz is usually a regular and brief evaluation that can gauge a small amount of knowledge being stored and understood. A TechQuiz will act as an interactive feedback system during a course, allowing both the teacher and the students to see where they are best or need more focus. This app will have below two button –

-	Start Quiz
-	Bookmarks
-   Share

TechQuiz will have option to bookmark the questions, if user finds it difficult to answer and wants to investigate more on the topic. User can also share the question with anyone. Also, I am planning to include Advertisements as while research I found that this is one of the ways to earn some money from the developed app. 

The app is designed in a way that it will include several categories listed below –

-	Java
-	Python
-	Oracle
-	Angular
-	JavaScript

Each category will contain question sets and as the number increases the difficulty level also increases. User can share or bookmark a question and can move to the next question. The attempted questions can also be visible on top and finally user will be able to see score.
